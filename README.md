## 📊 Featured Projects

### 🎨 Project 1: CuratorAI - Personalized Art Discovery System
**Domain:** Cultural Technology & Recommendation Systems | **Model:** Content-Based Filtering + TF-IDF + Nearest Neighbors

**Business Context:** Major museums like The Metropolitan Museum of Art face engagement challenges with their digital collections. With 470,000+ artworks available online, visitors need intelligent ways to discover relevant content rather than browsing manually.

**Technical Solution:** Built a content-based recommendation engine using The Met's Open Access dataset. The system analyzes textual features (title, artist, culture, period, classification) to find semantic similarities between artworks and suggest personalized discoveries.

**Key Features:**
* 🎯 **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Find visually and thematically similar artworks using cosine similarity on TF-IDF vectors.
* 🏛️ **Met Collection Integration**: Direct access to 470,000+ artworks from The Metropolitan Museum's Open Access API.
* 📱 **Interactive Web Application**: Streamlit-based interface with real-time recommendations.
* 🔗 **Direct Museum Links**: Seamless connection to artwork pages on metmuseum.org for high-resolution images.
* 🗺️ **Thematic Exploration**: Filter by department, culture, and time period.

**Tech Stack:** Python, Scikit-learn, TF-IDF, Nearest Neighbors, Streamlit, Pandas, Joblib, Requests

**Live Demo:** [Coming Soon] | **Code:** [Coming Soon]

### 📱 Project 2: Megaline Plan Recommendation Engine
**Domain:** Telecommunications | **Model:** Random Forest Classifier (88% Accuracy)

**Business Context:** Telecom operators typically experience 15-25% annual churn rates. Identifying customers at risk and recommending optimal service plans is critical for retention and revenue optimization.

**Technical Solution:** Developed a classification system that analyzes customer usage patterns (call minutes, data usage, text messages) to recommend the most suitable mobile plan, reducing misaligned subscriptions and improving customer satisfaction.

**Key Features:**
* 📈 **Batch Processing**: Analyze entire customer datasets for segmentation opportunities
* 👤 **Individual Recommendations**: Real-time plan suggestions with confidence scoring
* 📊 **Usage Analytics**: Interactive visualizations of customer behavior patterns
* 📥 **Operational Integration**: Export functionality for CRM and marketing systems

**Model Performance:**
* Accuracy: 88%
* Precision: 0.87
* Recall: 0.85
* F1-Score: 0.86

**Tech Stack:** Python, Streamlit, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Joblib, Plotly

**Live Demo:** [View Application](https://megalineapppy-tsf.streamlit.app/) | **Code:** [megaline_plans/](https://github.com/RosellaAM/Production-ML-Showcase/blob/main/megaline_plans/megaline_app.py)
